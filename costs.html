                            metering, a bi-directional meter records both the electricity the home draws from the grid
                            and the excess electricity the homeowner’s system feeds back into the grid. A ground-mounted
                            solar system, solar water heater, and solar roof tile do qualify for the federal tax credit.

                        There are three different wind turbines that can be used by homeowners.

                        <br>
                        Usually, it costs around 2000$ to 5000$.
                        These won’t save enough for you to break even on your purchase.
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        Costs between $3,000 to $5,000
                        These can’t provide enough power for the whole house.
                        <br>

                        <span class="greenHeading">Standalone domestic wind turbines: </span>
                        <br>
                        Most homeowners using a wind turbine as their primary source of electricity install between 5 to
                        15 kW of wind power capacity, meaning they can expect to pay between $15,000 and $75,000.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It'll take around 20.6 years to break even on a 2.5 kW standalone domestic wind turbine. This is
                        also the average lifespan of a domestic wind turbine, so the return on investment isn't great.

                        Grid-connected wind systems are particularly cost-effective because excess electricity is sent
                        back to the power grid and can earn homeowners’ direct rebates or credits from local utility
                        providers.

                        A geothermal heat pump reduces energy costs by 30-70% on average which is why homeowners can
                        typically recoup investments in a geothermal installation through energy savings in 5 to 7
                        years.

                        The geothermal heating and cooling system buried in the ground usually has a five-year warranty
                        and inside the home, the geothermal heat pump unit has a lifecycle of an average of twenty-five
                        years, making them one of the most long-lasting systems on the market.

                        Carbon offset credits: In the USA carbon offset credits can be earned by reducing the greenhouse
                        gas emissions such as methane recovered from the biogas system. These credits have a monetary
                        value and can be bought and sold on commodity exchanges.

                        <br>
                        Carbon credits are calculated based on the amount of methane reduced through the installation of
                        an anaerobic digester. This approach considers:

                        Hydropower is very site-specific Most homes will not have access to a suitable resource even if
                        they have a water stream running nearby.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        To be suitable for electricity generation, a water source needs to have a combination of:

                        <br>
                        Flow – how much water is flowing per second.

                        <br>
                        Also, in summer if the water flow is minimal then it might not work.

                        Costs for installing a hydro system vary, largely depending on the location and equipment
                        required for installation.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Micro-hydro costs run from $1,500 to $4,000 per kilowatt of installed capacity.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A fully functioning system that can power an average household costs around $20,000. This cost
                        can go up or down based on location and the system’s capacity.
                        <br>

                        Maintenance costs also vary but are usually low.

                        Once installed, most systems can last for 40-50 years, with low running and maintenance costs,
                        and could last for longer if well maintained.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        There is potential for damage by debris carried downstream at times of flood, however, screening
                        the intake should minimize this risk.

                        <br>
                        This is a voluntary program that encourages organizations, including homeowners, to purchase
                        green power. Don't forget that there is no cost!

                        <br>
                        1. Using green power will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollutants.

                        <br>
                        2. Green power helps to combat climate change by reducing the use of fossil fuels.

                        <br>
                        3. Green power can help to improve air quality and public health.

                        <br>
                        4. Joining the Green Power Partnership shows that your organization is committed to
                        environmental
                        responsibility.

                        also known as cogeneration, is an efficient technology that utilizes a single fuel source to
                        generate both electricity and heat.

                        <br>
                        CHP systems convert up to 90% of the fuel's energy into usable energy, significantly reducing
                        energy waste compared to conventional power plants.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        They generate both electricity and heat on-site, resulting in lower energy costs.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        CHP systems produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions when compared to fossil fuels.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        On-site generation can provide backup power during outages.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        CHP systems create jobs in manufacturing, installation, and maintenance.

                        Micro-CHP Systems: These smaller and more affordable systems are specifically designed for
                        residential use. Typically fueled by natural gas, they can generate up to 5 kW of electricity
                        and provide heating and hot water. Micro-CHP systems typically cost between $15,000 and $25,000
                        to install including equipment and labor.

                        Packaged CHP Systems: These pre-configured systems offer a convenient and streamlined
                        installation process but may be less customizable. These systems can cost upwards of $30,000
                        installed.

                        Maintenance Requirements: Regular maintenance is necessary to ensure optimal performance and
                        efficiency, which ranges from $500 to $1,000 per year.
